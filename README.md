# Car Cost Prediction
Numpy, Pandas, sckit-learn,keras

## About the Project
This project utilises a 3-layered neural network to predict the the cost of the car based on number of factors 
During the Data-exploration the plots highly suggested that a linear model would suit this data hence a linear model is also applied here

## Key Observations
1) Due to the small size of the data-set large number of settings and various settings could be explored which cannot occur on larger datsets
2) As expected the data follows a linear relationship which is highly logical and also proven mathematically here
3) In the end Car cost of some new data is predicted
4) This Project follows 20-80 test-train split which was obtained after trying a number of different settings
